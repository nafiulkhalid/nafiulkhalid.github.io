    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Portfolio Website** is designed to showcase various projects, research, and achievements. It provides a simple and engaging interface for visitors to explore detailed project descriptions, view associated technologies, and interact with images through carousels. The site also includes a **real-time local time display** of **Miami**, where I resides, ensuring a personalized experience for visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Idea: \n",
    "Website with separate webpages, accessible via naviagtion bar. <br>\n",
    "Publising via GitHub Pages <br>\n",
    "Allocated timeline 48hours --> 2 hour of design & plan, 36 hours of development, 10 hours in hand for debugging & adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. System Overview**\n",
    "\n",

    "## **4. System Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio website follows a **client-server model**. Since the website is static, there is no backend server involved, and all content is pre-built and deployed as static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Client-Side**:\n",
    "- Responsible for rendering content and handling user interactions.\n",
    "- Uses **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap** for layout and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Server-Side**:\n",
    "- There is no dynamic server-side logic since the website is entirely static.\n",
    "- The content is hosted and served from **static hosting platforms** like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Technologies Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Frontend**:\n",
    "- **HTML5**: Structuring the content and building semantic web pages.\n",
    "- **CSS3**: Styling the website, including layout, colors, and typography.\n",
    "- **JavaScript**: For interactive features such as the real-time clock and carousels.\n",
    "- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive design and using pre-built components (e.g., navigation bar, cards, carousel).\n",
    "- **FontAwesome / Bootstrap Icons**: For including icons (e.g., GitHub, Devpost).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Backend**:\n",
    "- **None** (static website).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **External Services**:\n",
    "- **GitHub**: For hosting project repositories.\n",
    "- **DevPost**: For showcasing projects and achievements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Database Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need for a database as the portfolio website is **static**. All content, including text, images, and links, is stored directly within the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Security**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTTPS**: The website will be served over HTTPS to ensure the integrity of content and protect data in transit.\n",
    "- **Sanitization**: Any user input (e.g., contact form) will be sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (**XSS**).\n",
    "- **No Sensitive Data**: The website does not store or handle any sensitive user data, thus minimizing security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "The website will be deployed on a static hosting platform -- **GitHub Pages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **CI/CD Pipeline**:\n",
    "- Continuous deployment can be achieved using **GitHub Actions** or other similar tools, ensuring smooth updates whenever content is modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit Testing**: JavaScript functions, particularly the real-time clock, will be tested.\n",
    "- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensuring compatibility across popular browsers such as **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, and **Edge**.\n",
    "- **Mobile Testing**: Testing the website on various mobile devices to ensure responsiveness.\n",
    "- **Accessibility Testing**: Tools like **WAVE** or **Lighthouse** will be used to ensure accessibility best practices are followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **10. Maintenance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content Updates**: The website content can be updated manually by modifying **HTML** files to add new projects or achievements.\n",
    "- **Image Optimization**: All images will be compressed and optimized for faster loading.\n",
    "- **Bug Fixing**: Any broken links, images, or functionality will be fixed promptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **11. Risks and Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring that the website functions correctly on older browsers, such as **Internet Explorer**, may be a challenge.\n",
    "- **Responsive Issues**: Ensuring proper layout and functionality across a wide variety of screen sizes and devices.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Ensuring fast page load times, particularly if images or media-heavy components are used.\n",
