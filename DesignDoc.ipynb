    "\n",
    "## **5. System Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The portfolio website follows a **client-server model**. Since the website is static, there is no backend server involved, and all content is pre-built and deployed as static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Client-Side**:\n",
    "- Responsible for rendering content and handling user interactions.\n",
    "- Uses **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap** for layout and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Server-Side**:\n",
    "- There is no dynamic server-side logic since the website is entirely static.\n",
    "- The content is hosted and served from **static hosting platforms** like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Technologies Used**\n",
